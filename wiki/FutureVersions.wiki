#summary Description of on-going work

= Trunk =

The SVN Trunk on this site contains TFTPgui version 2.x

Any ongoing changes in the Trunk will mainly be to remove any bugs found, and perhaps to improve the code documentation, it is not envisaged that any major features will be added, as the aim of TFTPgui is to be simple.

Version 2 will be compatible with Python 2.5 to 2.7 and will remain so.

You can checkout the Trunk for the most recent changes, but they will not be significantly different from the tarballed version. New version 2.2 will only be tarballed and released if a bug is corrected,
